# Rulify

(The goal is to create) Extensible, efficient rule engine for your app!

Enough dealing with those retarded home-brew rule engines!
The truth is that often having a bunch of javascripty dropdowns is not flexible enough, making you jump through the hoops to add new stuff.
And all of this is tied inseparably with templates-javascripts-activerecords-and-who-knows-what-else. And God forbid they say they want to reuse this for that damn thingy!
But it's all simple now - you provide inputs and hook up outputs, they provide rules, themselves.

Wouldn't that be great? No hard-code, no loads of DB queries. Pure. Simple. Robust. Fast.

Let's see if that can indeed happen!
